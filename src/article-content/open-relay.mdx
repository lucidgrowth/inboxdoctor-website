### Open Relay Check: The Security Gatekeeper for Your Email Server

An Open Relay Check tests whether your email server allows unauthorized users to send emails through it, a vulnerability known as an "open relay." It’s like checking if your email server’s door is locked—ensuring only trusted senders can use it to deliver messages.

### Open Relay Check 101: The Basics of Server Security

Imagine your email server as a post office—if it’s an "open relay," anyone can walk in and send mail under your name, leading to spam abuse. An Open Relay Check verifies that your server is secure by attempting to send an unauthorized email through it. If the server rejects the attempt, it’s properly configured. If it allows the email, it’s an open relay, which can tank your deliverability and reputation.

### Benefits of Open Relay Check for Email Deliverability

Ensuring your server isn’t an open relay is critical for email deliverability and sender reputation. Here’s why an Open Relay Check matters:

- **Prevents Spam Abuse:** A closed relay stops spammers from using your server, keeping your domain off blacklists.
- **Protects Sender Reputation:** Open relays get flagged by email providers, lowering your trust score—a secure server maintains your credibility.
- **Improves Inbox Placement:** Email providers like Gmail reject emails from open relays; a secure server ensures better delivery rates.
- **Avoids Blacklisting:** Open relays are quickly blacklisted, blocking your emails (e.g., marketing, transactional)—a clean check keeps you safe.
- **Reduces Delivery Failures:** Servers often reject emails from domains with open relays; passing the check ensures smooth delivery.
- **Enhances Security:** A closed relay prevents unauthorized access, protecting your email system from abuse and hacks.
- **Builds Recipient Trust:** Recipients are less likely to mark your emails as spam if your server isn’t linked to abuse.
- **Supports Compliance:** Many email standards require secure relays—passing the check aligns with best practices.
- **Works with STARTTLS:** A secure relay often supports STARTTLS (encryption), further boosting trust and deliverability.
- **Future-Proofs Your Server:** As email security tightens, avoiding open relays will remain key to maintaining deliverability.

### Breaking Down Open Relay Check’s Key Components

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Session Transcript</td>
      <td>
        Detailed SMTP communication log (e.g., EHLO, RCPT TO commands) showing
        the relay test attempt.

    <tr>
      <td>Test Result</td>
      <td>
        Outcome of the check (e.g., “No Open Relay Detected”), confirming the
        server’s security status.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>STARTTLS Status</td>
      <td>
        Indicates if STARTTLS is enabled (e.g., “STARTTLS: Enabled”), adding an
        encryption layer.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Test Status</td>
      <td>
        Confirms if the test completed successfully, ensuring the result is

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SMTP Connection</td>
      <td>We initiate an SMTP session with your server (e.g., on port 25).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Command Sequence</td>
      <td>
        We send commands like EHLO and RCPT TO, attempting an unauthorized relay
        (e.g., to a test email).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Server Response</td>
      <td>
        We analyze the server’s response (e.g., “Host not found” or rejection),
        confirming it blocks unauthorized relays.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Result Analysis</td>
      <td>
        We confirm the result (e.g., “No Open Relay Detected”) and check for
        STARTTLS support.
      </td>
    </tr>
